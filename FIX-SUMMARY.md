# Fix Summary: Services Not Showing

## Problem
The production system showed tag numbers and deep links worked, but no services were displayed on the start page, even when filtering by tags.

## Root Cause
The `publishedAt` filter in `entityService.findMany()` was not working in the Strapi v5 GraphQL resolver. The filter syntax `{ publishedAt: { $notNull: true } }` returned 0 results even though 195 published services existed in the database.

## Solution
**File:** `src/index.ts` - `servicesbytags` resolver

**Changed from:**
```typescript
const queryOptions = {
    filters: {
        publishedAt: {
            $notNull: true,  // ❌ This filter doesn't work!
        },
    },
    populate: { tags: true },
};
const services = await strapi.entityService.findMany("api::service.service", queryOptions);
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
// Fetch all services without filters
const allServices = await strapi.entityService.findMany("api::service.service", {
    populate: { tags: true },
});

// Filter published services manually in JavaScript
const publishedServices = allServices.filter(service => service.publishedAt !== null);
```

## Files Changed

### Backend (Strapi)
- **`src/index.ts`** - Fixed the `servicesbytags` GraphQL resolver to:
  1. Remove broken `publishedAt` filter from entityService query
  2. Filter published services manually in JavaScript
  3. Properly filter by tags
  4. Sort results manually

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Changed to load ALL services instead of just featured ones:
  ```typescript
  const allServices = await fetchServices([])  // Loads all published services
  ```
- **Removed debug logging** from:
  - `src/lib/strapi.ts`
  - `src/components/new/InteractiveServiceList.tsx`

## Testing Results
- ✅ Local Strapi: Returns 195 services
- ✅ With no tags: Returns all 195 published services
- ✅ With tag filter: Correctly filters by tags
- ✅ Sorting: Works correctly (slug:asc)

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Backend (Strapi)
```bash
# Already built with: npm run build

# For production deployment:
# 1. Commit changes
# 2. Push to repository
# 3. Deploy to production server
# 4. Restart Strapi
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
cd awesomeapps.frontend
npm run build
# Deploy the built files to production
```

### 3. Verify
After deployment:
1. Visit production site
2. Should see all 195 services on start page
3. Test tag filtering - should work correctly
4. Test deep links - should continue to work

## Technical Notes

### Why the Filter Broke
- Strapi v5's `entityService.findMany()` has issues with certain filter formats
- The `$notNull` operator doesn't work as expected in the GraphQL resolver context
- Even alternative formats like `$ne: null` failed
- The workaround is to fetch all and filter manually

### Performance Considerations
- Fetching all services and filtering in JavaScript is acceptable for ~200 services
- If the database grows significantly (1000+ services), consider:
  - Using direct database queries with Knex
  - Implementing proper pagination
  - Caching results
