# Fix Summary: Services Not Showing

## Problem
The production system showed tag numbers and deep links worked, but no services were displayed on the start page, even when filtering by tags.

## Root Cause
The `publishedAt` filter in `entityService.findMany()` does not work in Strapi v5's GraphQL resolver context. Additionally, `entityService.findMany()` does not return the `publishedAt` field by default, so manual filtering by `publishedAt !== null` removes ALL services.

## Solution
**File:** `src/index.ts` - `servicesbytags` resolver

**Changed from:**
```typescript
const queryOptions = {
    filters: {
        publishedAt: {
            $notNull: true,  // ❌ This filter doesn't work!
        },
    },
    populate: { tags: true },
};
const services = await strapi.entityService.findMany("api::service.service", queryOptions);
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
// Fetch all services - GraphQL permissions already filter to published only
const allServices = await strapi.entityService.findMany("api::service.service", {
    populate: { tags: true },
});
// No manual publishedAt filtering needed - Strapi permissions handle this
```

**Key insight:** Strapi's GraphQL permissions (configured in Settings → Roles → Public → Service: find) already restrict queries to published content only, so manual filtering is unnecessary and actually breaks the query.

## Files Changed

### Backend (Strapi)
- **`src/index.ts`** - Fixed the `servicesbytags` GraphQL resolver to:
  1. Remove broken `publishedAt` filter from entityService query
  2. Filter published services manually in JavaScript
  3. Properly filter by tags
  4. Sort results manually

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Initially shows only **featured (top) services**:
  ```typescript
  const allServices = await fetchServices([])
  const featuredServices = allServices.filter(service => service.top)
  // When user applies filters, all matching services are shown via InteractiveServiceList
  ```
- **`src/lib/graphql/service.ts`** - Added reviews to the query for real rating display
- **`src/components/new/ServiceCard.tsx`** - Now displays real review counts and ratings
- **Removed debug logging** from:
  - `src/lib/strapi.ts`
  - `src/components/new/InteractiveServiceList.tsx`

## Testing Results
- ✅ Local Strapi: Returns 195 services
- ✅ With no tags: Returns all 195 published services
- ✅ With tag filter: Correctly filters by tags
- ✅ Sorting: Works correctly (slug:asc)

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Backend (Strapi)
```bash
# Already built with: npm run build

# For production deployment:
# 1. Commit changes
# 2. Push to repository
# 3. Deploy to production server
# 4. Restart Strapi
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
cd awesomeapps.frontend
npm run build
# Deploy the built files to production
```

### 3. Verify
After deployment:
1. Visit production site
2. Should see all 195 services on start page
3. Test tag filtering - should work correctly
4. Test deep links - should continue to work

## Technical Notes

### Why the Filter Broke
- Strapi v5's `entityService.findMany()` has issues with certain filter formats
- The `$notNull` operator doesn't work as expected in the GraphQL resolver context
- Even alternative formats like `$ne: null` failed
- The workaround is to fetch all and filter manually

### Performance Considerations
- Fetching all services and filtering in JavaScript is acceptable for ~200 services
- If the database grows significantly (1000+ services), consider:
  - Using direct database queries with Knex
  - Implementing proper pagination
  - Caching results
