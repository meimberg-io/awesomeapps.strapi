You are editing a Strapi 5.x project.

- Use the new Factories API (`createCoreController`, `createCoreService`, `createCoreRouter`).
- Keep a clear separation between content-types, components, and plugins.
- In GraphQL resolvers: define explicit types, never use `any`.
- Write services as pure modules without side effects.
- Use `env()` access for configuration, never hard-code environment variables.
