You are working inside a Next.js 15 project using the App Router.

- Default to React Server Components.
- Add `"use client"` only when truly required.
- Implement SEO via `metadata()` instead of `head`.
- Use `next/image` for all image imports.
- Organize dynamic routes cleanly.
- Keep layout files minimal but consistent.
- Avoid unnecessary wrappers or anonymous default exports.
